we present <tt>ARNOLD</tt>, a benchmark that evaluates **language-grounded** task learning with **continuous states** in **realistic 3D scenes**. We highlight the following major points: (1) <tt>ARNOLD</tt> is built on **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, equipped with **photo-realistic** and **physically-accurate** simulation, covering **40 distinctive objects** and **20 scenes**. (2) <tt>ARNOLD</tt> is comprised of **8 language-conditioned tasks** that involve understanding object states and learning policies for continuous goals. For each task, there are **7 data splits** including *i.i.d.* evaluation and **unseen generalization**. (3) <tt>ARNOLD</tt> provides **10k expert demonstrations** with diverse template-generated language instructions, based on thousands of human annotations. (4) We assess the task performances of the latest language-conditioned policy learning models. The results indicate that current models for language-conditioned manipulation **still struggle in understanding continuous states and producing precise motion control**. We hope these findings can foster future research to address the unsolved challenges in **instruction grounding** and **precise continuous motion control**.
